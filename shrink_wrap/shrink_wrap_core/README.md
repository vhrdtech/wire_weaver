> shrink_wrap wire format code generator

There is very likely no need for you to depend on this crate directly, please
use [shrink_wrap](https://crates.io/crates/shrink_wrap) which uses this crate internally.

This crate also exposes AST types and several helper functions used by shrink_wrap_derive proc_macro crate and
[WireWeaver](https://github.com/vhrdtech/wire_weaver).
