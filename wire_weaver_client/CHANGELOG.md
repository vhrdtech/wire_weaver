## Unreleased

### 🚀 Features

- `DeviceInfo` is filled from the USB API id interface string (falling back to the product string): API name,
  version, truncated hash and user label are known without opening the device, so `.user_label_eq()` and
  `.implements_api()` filters now work for USB. `DeviceInfo` gains `location` and implements `Display`.
- `list_usb_devices()` lists devices reporting an API id, `list_all_usb_devices()` lists all USB devices, neither
  opens a device.
- `ClientConfig::client_version()` sets the API crate name and version sent to the device during link setup.

### 🐛 Fixes

- Connect intermittently failed (about half of the attempts on real hardware): when the transport's rx half and
  `TransportUp` arrived at the same time, the rx task could drop the rx half, closing the USB IN endpoint. The device
  reply was then never read, and a stale `DeviceInfo` was left for the next session.
- First request sent right after `connect()` returned could be rejected with "ignoring SendMessage while
  disconnected", because rx unblocks the caller before tx sees `LinkReady`. Requests arriving during link setup are
  now held and sent once the link is up, or failed with `Disconnected` if setup fails.
- Generated clients never sent their API version (empty `crate_id` in `LinkSetup`), so they were treated as dynamic
  clients and version compatibility was not checked on either side. It is now set automatically.
